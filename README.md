## Ediblio

#### About

Ediblio is a web application for adding, sharing, and managing recipes and grocery lists. The primary application is for
adding recipes from users' favorite food blogs etc, sharing with others, and quickly adding those recipes to their menus and grocery lists.
Users may also upload their own recipes. Users also can create collections of recipes which serve as a categorization method for their
own or others' recipes, and users have the ability to follow other users' collections. When populating a grocery list, Ediblio smartly
adds ingredients together so that users only see one of each ingredient needed whenever possible.

#### Tech

Ediblio uses NextJS to server-side render a Node/React application with PostgreSQL as its database.
